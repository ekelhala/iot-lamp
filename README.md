# IoT lamp project

## Introduction

IoT lamp is a lamp that in addition to providing light, also senses its surroundings and provides data on them. This can include for example indoor temperature and humidity, which can ultimately be used as inputs into some other system, like air conditioner.

The project consists of software that is meant for the device itself, as well as for the server that receives and processes the data.
